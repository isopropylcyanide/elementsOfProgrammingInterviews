### Working Java Solutions with driver programs for problems presented in Elements Of Programming Interviews ###
This repository will contain working solutions in Java to the problems presented in Elements of Programming Interviews book by Adnan Aziz | Tsung-HSIEN LEE | AMIT PRAKASH

It is a great book and I'd recommend everyone to go through the problems once. Pseudocode in the book is mostly C++, so I've thought about sharing one for Java.

## Organization

- The source is organized into packages with the same name as the book chapters. For eg, stacks package refers to the chapter on Stacks, BST on Binary Search Tree etc

- It might not always be one to one. But I've added enough documentation for you to quickly find the program you're searching for
- In some cases, I've also submitted the solutions on LeetCode or other sites (if they are available). For such programs, I've specified the link to the problem as well.

## Contribution

- Please feel free to raise a PR
- Maintain the same consistency of the source
